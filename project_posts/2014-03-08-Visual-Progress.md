Third prototype- After thinking it over, we thought that interaction became overcomplicated with the 'like/dislike' function, so we removed it. We came with a new idea: we can generate a POSTER with a poem.

We chose Google Image as a source for visual elements. However, most search results of a single word are clip arts. We tried different ways to manipulate those images. Finally we decided to flatten those images in to a single one, trim it to a triangle and tile the triangle to form a kaleidoscopic background. We used that method to convert a random set images to an artistic collage.We put poem on that kaleidoscopic background to finish the poster. And it looks great each time.
