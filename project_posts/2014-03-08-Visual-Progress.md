Third prototype- After thinking it over, we thought that interaction became overcomplicated with the 'like/dislike' function, so we removed it. We came with a new idea: we can generate a POSTER with a poem.

We ended up doing the kaleidoscope visual because we were really struggling with how to do a compelling visual. When you search for individual words in google images, since we are searching for single words the search results are often really terrible clip art. You can see in this test we did with the word "camp", that the image results are pretty horiffic.

We tried different ways to manipulate those images. Finally we decided to flatten those images in to a single one, trim it to a triangle and tile the triangle to form a kaleidoscopic background. We used that method to convert a random set images to an artistic collage.We put poem on that kaleidoscopic background to finish the poster. And it looks great each time.
