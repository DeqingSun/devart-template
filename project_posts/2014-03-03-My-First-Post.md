Context: How do we draw attention to our everyday language?

Everyday we're barraged with headlines, tweets and streams of text screaming for attention (or clicks). With the 24/7 news cycle and infinite scroll, it becomes easy to gloss over words like words like 'epidemic', 'terror', 'tragedy' and because their usage has become so common.

So we were curious in ways we could draw attention to the individual words used in the headline news. By isolating them, is it possible to draw attention and question how and why they're being used- simply by allowing us a moment to pause and reflect? 

Concept: What if you could make black out poetry from the news?
Blackout poetry has long been a creative technique to derive meaning through reduction. So we thought it would be interesting to try and create black out poems from the news.

Instead of using newspapers and sharpies, we decided to use google news and a physical interface to make black out poems. We thought the interface should be playful and a user should be able to quickly create a poem within a short amount of time. We thought a plinko interface would be a good fit since it meets all those requirements and allows the user a certain amount of control while still having some element of randomness and chance.  

Content: Live streaming google news and images
Input- we are going to scrape google news since it's an endless source of renewed text. Also, for every word in the blackout poem we wanted to do a google image search and add an extra visual element to it. How we are going to display the visual element is TBD, but thought it would be a nice addition. 

Output- All the poems will be saved and published online- creating a collaboratively created book of poetry. We may try to print either posters live or a book further down the road.
