##Context: Overloaded and overwhelmed with news

Everyday we're barraged with headlines, tweets and streams of text screaming for attention (or clicks). With the 24/7 news cycle and infinite scroll, it becomes easy to gloss over words like words like 'epidemic', 'terror', 'tragedy' because their usage has become so common. 

It's an overwhelming and desensitizing experience, so we are motivated to create a counter experience. One that allows us to pause this constant stream. To simply have a moment to focus on the individual words, we hope to draw attention to them and reflect on how and why they're being used. 

##Concept: What if you could make black out poetry from the news?
Blackout poetry has long been a creative technique to derive meaning through reduction. So we thought it would be interesting to try and create black out poems from the news. It seemed like a fitting technique and analogy for our idea of reducing complexity into simplicity. 

Turning the news into a black out poem:

Instead of using newspapers and sharpies, we decided to use google news and a physical interface to make black out poems. We thought the interface should be playful and a user should be able to quickly create a poem within a short amount of time. We thought a plinko interface would be a good fit since it meets all those requirements and allows the user a certain amount of control while still having some element of randomness and chance.

Input- we are going to pull google news since it's an endless source of renewable text. The idea would be to as often as we can, scrape the news and feed it into the physical interface that way there will always be new and different text to play with. 

Output- All the poems will be saved and published online- creating a collaboratively created book of poetry. We may try to publish a physical book of blackout poems in the future.
