Here is our previous version of Plinko-Poetry.

When a user drops a chip, it randomly hits pegs on the way down. The word under each peg that is hit is highlighted, with the untouched pegs automatically darkened. Plinko Poetry uses camera tracking to determine which pegs have been encountered. When the chip comes to a stop, the user is left with a trail of blackout poetry.

We will keep this Plinko as an on-site interaction. For people off-site, they can play this project on their tablet or phone with their fingers.
