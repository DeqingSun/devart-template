Here are some posters generated with Plinko Poetry. You can see more on http://plinko-poetry.appspot.com/gallery.

If you want to add your poster to gallery, disable "same-origin policy" in your browser and adjust window resolution to 480*640. Then your poster will be uploaded automatically. We will play around with the fonts and styling a little later, but want to document a working version.
