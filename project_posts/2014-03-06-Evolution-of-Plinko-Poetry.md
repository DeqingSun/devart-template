#Prototype evolution

This project has envolved through many stages in the past few weeks. Here are 3 main stages it has been:

First prototype- The first version implemented the most basic concept: Blackout poetry. This scaled mobile version will generate a black out poem when you silde your finger through all text.

Second prototype- The second version added like or dislike function. When a poem is generated, the creator can read the poem first and decide if they like it or not. "Like" and "Dislike" will be recorded along with the poem and a different visual effect will show up as feedback.

Third prototype- After thinking it over, we thought that interaction became overcomplicated with the 'like/dislike' function, so we removed it. We came with a new idea: we can generate a POSTER with a poem.

We chose Google Image as a source for visual elements. However, most search results of a single word are clip arts. We tried different ways to manipulate those images. Finally we decided to flatten those images in to a single one, trim it to a triangle and tile the triangle to form a kaleidoscopic background. We used that method to convert a random set images to an artistic collage. We put poem on that kaleidoscopic background to finish the poster. And it looks great each time.
