#Prototype evolution

This project has envolved through many stages in the past few weeks. Here are the first couple prototypes:

First prototype- The first version implemented the most basic concept: Blackout poetry. This scaled mobile version will generate a black out poem when you silde your finger through all text.

Second prototype- The second version added like or dislike function. When a poem is generated, the creator can read the poem first and decide if they like it or not. "Like" and "Dislike" will be recorded along with the poem and a different visual effect will show up as feedback.
