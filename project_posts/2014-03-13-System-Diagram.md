System Diagram

For on-site installation, there will be one interactive screen and a few screens showing recently generated posters. Player can drop a chip, and it randomly hits pegs on the way down. The chip's path will be recoreded by a webcam, which highlights the word under each peg, with the untouched pegs automatically darkened. Then a poster will be generated with that poem and images from Google Image with selected keywords. 

Once a poster is generated, it will be inserted into the timeline of posters. If viewers like any poster on screen, they can print it as a souvenir.
