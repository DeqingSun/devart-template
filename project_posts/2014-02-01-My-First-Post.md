We're excited to start this process and starting to piece together how we're going to execute over the next few weeks. Some inital thoughts for the project.

Some initial thoughts on themes we'd like to explore in the project. 

-Blackout poetry is interesting because it tries to create more meaning with less. By reducing and decontextualizing the information, can we derive more meaning? We want to explore that question in a playful way with a game interface.

-Aesthetics of automation and procedural art
Automation in art is also an area we want to explore as it brings up questions of co-collaboration vs authorship, creating systems vs creating individual words, and variety within constraints. We added a visual element to the poems as it will be an interesting challenge to address it in the work.

-Subverting media
By scraping news headlines and using it as our corpus, the installation seeks to isolate the words which by volume can be overwhelming and create loss of meaning. Sensational words become highlighted and allow the user to view them and experience them differently.
