Some of our preliminary tests/prototypes on the visuals. 

## Test one

We did a couple simple versions of repetition, but we ran into a couple challenges.	
1) Because we are searching for one word each, google image search results return a lot of clip art, which just doesn't look that good. 
2) It was difficult to make a decision on font color would provide the most contrast due to the images returning an array of unpredictable colors.
3) Even though we liked the directness of the images, it overall felt a little too simple and one to one. 

## Test two
We then thought about manipulating the z-axis, but it felt less conceptually compelling.

## Test three
Finally we experimented with a kaleidoscopic effect and came up with a system for combining multiple images into one that the kaleidoscopic image processing could alter. We liked it for several reasons:
1) Procedurally we were able to combine the images to create one unified image that looked nice and provides endless variety within constraints.
2) The visual footprint of the images are present, without being too literal. 
3) Eliminates the overwhelming amount of clip art results.
