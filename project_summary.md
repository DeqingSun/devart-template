## Description
Plinko Poetry is an experimental platform that allows users to playfully deconstruct our everyday images and words and reconstruct them into a new visual and textual corpus. 

The input is google images and headlines that we scrape continuously. By playing the machine, you will generate a poem from a constantly renewing source. The form and meaning will derive directly from the artifacts of the headlines and images of an ephermeral moment in digital history. 

The output will be a collection of digital book of poems, co-created by the system, the users and the internet. Each new poem created by the Plinko machine will be displayed in a gallery and then published automatically online.

We think this will be a fun exploration in disrupting our stream of digital content and ways we can re-imagine the way we consume, create and publish.
