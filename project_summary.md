## Description
Kaleidoscopic Plinko Poetry is an experimental platform that allows users to playfully deconstruct our everyday headline news and images, and reconstruct them generatively into a new visual and textual corpus. 

Users walk up to the installation and drop a plinko chip down a physical interface. By playing the chip, you will create blackout poetry from the text that is displayed on the screen. The text is google news headlines that are continuously scraped from their site. The algorithm then returns the top image result for each word and creates a unique, generative visual for each poem. The form and meaning will derive directly from the artifacts of the headlines and images of an ephermeral moment in digital history. 

The output will be a digital book of poems and a collaborative creation by the system, the users and the zeitgeist of the internet. Each new poem created by the Plinko machine will be displayed in the updatable physical gallery and then published automatically online. On site, users will also be able to print out posters of their poem as a token of their participation. There is also a mobile version for users not able to visit the installation. 

We think this will be a fun exploration in disrupting our stream of digital content and ways we can re-imagine the way we consume, create and publish.
